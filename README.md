# AZS- Aleph Zero Snap

## Inspiration
Our project was born out of the desire to create a seamless experience for MetaMask users within the Aleph Zero ecosystem. We envisioned a world where interacting with Aleph Zero accounts via MetaMask was not just effortless, but also enriched the user experience.

## What it Does
Aleph Zero Snap simplifies the process of creating, managing, and transacting with Aleph Zero accounts using MetaMask. By integrating MetaMask functionalities into the Aleph Zero polkadot.js wallet, we have crafted a smooth and user-friendly interface for seamless transactions.

## What's Next for Aleph Zero Snap
Our journey doesnâ€™t end here. We are committed to enhancing the Aleph Zero Snap further by adding more quality-of-life functions. Additionally, we plan to integrate it even more closely with the Aleph Zero and Polkadot ecosystems, ensuring a holistic and seamless experience for users.
